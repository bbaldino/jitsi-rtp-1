 * [UnparsedReadOnlySrtpPacket] is either an SRTP packet or SRTCP packet (but we don't know which)
 * so it basically just distinguishes a packet as encrypted and stores the buffer
 * TODO(brian): technically this should only be converted into either ImmutableSrtpPacket or
 * ImmutableSrtcpPacket, but the first ancestor those 2 types have in common is ImmutablePacket,
 * so we use that here in Convertible.  It'd be nice if we could have a lower ancestor, but it's
 * tricky currently.
