/**
 * To get the original [RtpPacket] from this [RtxPacket], just use it
 * as the [RtpPacket] instance
 */
/**
 * There are 3 different paths for creating an [RtxPacket]:
 * 1) Encapsulating an existing RTP packet in RTX to be sent
 * out as a retransmission
 * 2) Converting an [RtpPacket] instance which was discovered to
 * actually be an RTX packet.
 * 3) Parsing an incoming RTX packet from the network (such that
 * the original RTP packet can be extracted).
 *
 * An instance of [RtxPacket] will have a header corresponding
 * to the RTX version of this packet, and a payload which contains
 * the original RTP payload (NOT the original sequence number).
 * The original sequence number will be added when [serializeTo]
 * is called.
